# Arnold for Blender #

Arnold for Blender (or BtoA) provides a bridge to the Arnold renderer from within Blender's standard interface. BtoA is an unofficial Blender add-on and is not affiliated with Autodesk or Arnold.

## How to Get BtoA ##
Arnold for Blender (BtoA 0.4.4-alpha) is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. [Go to the downloads page](https://github.com/lunadigital/btoa/releases).

## Licensing & Installation
Although the Arnold SDK is [free to download](https://www.arnoldrenderer.com/download/) from Autodesk, you need to purchase a license to render without watermarks - we do not provide licenses with BtoA. Licences are reasonably priced and can be purchased on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis on the [Autodesk website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/arnold/overview).

For installation instructions, [visit the project wiki](https://github.com/lunadigital/btoa/wiki).

## Documentation & Support ##
We're still working on proper documentation for BtoA, including additional wiki pages and YouTube tutorials. In the meantime, the [Arnold for Blender Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/4QYv3vMGxS) is a great place to ask questions and get help.

For Arnold-specific resources, take a look at the list below.

- [Arnold for Maya User Guide](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/a5AFMUG/Arnold+for+Maya+User+Guide) (although this resource is specifically for Arnold in Maya, it can still be very helpful for understanding how to use Arnold in general)
- [Arnold Node Reference](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/A5NodeRef)
- [Arnold Answers](https://answers.arnoldrenderer.com/index.html)

Arnold for Blender (BtoA) is not affiliated with or supported by Autodesk. For bug reports, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/lunadigital/btoa/issues) on the issue tracker and we'll look into it!
