## Documentation & Support ##

For Arnold-specific resources, take a look at Autodesk's website:

- [Arnold for Maya User Guide](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/a5AFMUG/Arnold+for+Maya+User+Guide) (although this resource is specifically for Arnold in Maya, it can still be very helpful for understanding how to use Arnold in general)
- [Arnold Node Reference](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/A5NodeRef)
- [Arnold Autodesk Forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/arnold/ct-p/arnold)
