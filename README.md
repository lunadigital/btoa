# Arnold for Blender

Arnold for Blender (BtoA) is a community-developed Blender add-on for the Arnold renderer.

## Requirements & Platforms
* Windows, macOS, Linux
* Blender 4.0 and above

## How to Get BtoA
BtoA is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Because it's been so long since the last BtoA release, ***we no longer recommend downloading from the releases page.*** We are working toward a new release but still need some time to squash bugs and clean up things behind the scenes. For now, follow these instructions to get up and running with the latest version of BtoA:

1. Download the latest 0.5.0 branch here: https://github.com/lunadigital/btoa/tree/dev.
2. Install the add-on in Blender and follow the new installation process. https://youtu.be/BLrZIc_prfo
3. Restart Blender and start rendering!

## Documentation & Support
We're still working on proper documentation for BtoA, including additional wiki pages and YouTube tutorials. In the meantime, the [Arnold for Blender Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/4QYv3vMGxS) is a great place to ask questions and get help.
